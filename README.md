* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

When Brian Armstrong first read the Bitcoin whitepaper back in 2010, he realized this computer science breakthrough
might be the key to unlock this vision of the future. He seen the oppertunity for every payment could be as fast, cheap, and
global as sending an email. Cryptocurrency could provide the core tenets of economic freedom to
anyone: property rights, sound money, free trade, and the ability to work how and where they want.
His vision was Economic freedom is a necessary.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Trading and speculation were the first major use cases to take off in cryptocurrency, just like people
rushed to buy domain names in the early days of the internet. But Coinbase is now seeing cryptocurrency
evolve into something much more important. People are using cryptocurrency to earn, spend, save,
stake, borrow, lend, vote, and perform many other types of economic activity. Companies are being
funded, getting early customers, and will eventually go public, all on the blockchain. It is not intended to replace the traditional economy, but
instead be a complement to it, much like email was to paper mail. The cryptoeconomy offers a more
global, free, and fair alternative to traditional economies that is native to the internet.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin. Coinbase offer a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader cryptoeconomy.

$456 Billion Lifetime Trading Volume

$90 Billion Assets on Platform

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Coinbase uses 50 technology products and services including HTML5 , jQuery , and Google Analytics , Coinbase is actively using 67 technologies for its website Coinbase needs to provide a seamless experience for consumers while taking steps to secure the environment in which they operate. For this, the company relies also on artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning tools from Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Landscape:

Coinbase is a digital currency exchange that allows people to buy, sell, and trade a variety of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. It is part of the broader financial technology (fintech) industry, which involves the use of technology to improve and disrupt traditional financial services.

In specific, Coinbase operates in the domain of cryptocurrency exchange and trading. It offers a platform for individuals and institutions to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, as well as a range of other services such as wallet storage, merchant solutions, and institutional custody.

There are many companies that are similar to Coinbase in the sense that they are all cryptocurrency exchanges. Some of the other major cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp. These companies all allow users to buy, sell, and trade various types of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, many of these companies also offer other services such as cryptocurrency wallets, where users can store their digital assets, and in some cases, even offer traditional banking services such as the ability to deposit and withdraw funds using fiat currency.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

There are a number of different metrics that fintech companies may use to measure their success. Some of the core metrics that are commonly used in the fintech industry include revenue, profitability, number of users, customer satisfaction, and adoption rates. Other metrics that may be important for some fintech companies include things like average transaction value, transaction volume, and retention rates. Ultimately, the specific metrics that a fintech company uses to measure its success will depend on its business model and goals.

Revenue plummeted more than 50% from a year earlier as traders turned away from cryptocurrencies. The company's financials turned south, resulting in a loss of $545 million after Coinbase generated a profit of over $400 million a year earlier.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Coinbase is one of the hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges launched since Bitcoin ... start-ups business remains the domain of upstarts like Coinbase and its rivals.

Coinbase earns the highest rating in the analysis and is followed by other US and European crypto exchanges that were established in the years following the emergence of Bitcoin and have been meeting stricter regulatory standards. These include New York-based Gemini, which was founded by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook lore; London-based Bitstamp; and San Francisco-based Kraken. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would advise to implement: Hedera Hashgraph

Pros. Hedera Hashgraph is faster than most major blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano. It can handle 10,000 transactions per second. Its low, predictable fees cost only $0.001 per transaction, as compared to Bitcoin's, which cost an average of $22.57, and Ethereum, ranging at $19.55.

A hashgraph is a data structure and algorithm used for distributed consensus. It is a type of directed acyclic graph (DAG) that uses a voting-based consensus mechanism to achieve high levels of performance and scalability. Unlike other distributed consensus algorithms, such as those used by blockchain networks, a hashgraph can achieve consensus without requiring participants to reach a global agreement on the order of transactions. This allows it to achieve high transaction speeds and low transaction costs. Hashgraph technology is used in a number of distributed applications, including distributed ledgers, digital currency systems, and peer-to-peer networks.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Coinbase is a unique company because it is one of the few cryptocurrency exchanges that allows users to withdraw their digital assets immediately after purchasing them using fiat currency. This sets Coinbase apart from many other exchanges, which often require users to wait for several days for their payment transactions to clear before they can access their funds. This feature can be especially useful for users who want to use their cryptocurrency to make payments or use decentralized applications. Additionally, Coinbase is also known for its user-friendly interface and its focus on security, which makes it a popular choice among both experienced and new cryptocurrency users.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Hedera is designed for fast, fair, and secure applications to take advantage of the efficiency of hashgraph on a decentralized, public network you can trust.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
